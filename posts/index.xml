      <description>Failing to build from source Recently I worked with schopin to solve a bug in the delve Debian package failing to build from source in the newly released Mantic Minotaur Ubuntu (https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1052030).
This bug appeared following a rebuild of the package, without any change to the package. The build failed because tests were failing.
The error message was not very useful:
=== RUN TestRecursiveStructure support.go:246: enabling recording for TestRecursiveStructure proc_test.go:1215: proc_test.</description>

      <description>tl;dr : https://github.com/upils/redirect-lib
We need redirectors I have started a project about redirectors. redirectors as in command and control redirectors.
My goal is to document and automate the deployment of various methods to redirect incoming traffic from a client (a compromized host) to another server (a C&amp;amp;C such as Cobalt Strike or Covenant). The main purpose of this kind of tool is to hide the main server address and thus gain flexibility.</description>
