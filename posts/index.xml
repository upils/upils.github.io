      <description>tl;dr : https://github.com/upils/redirect-lib
We need redirectors I have started a project about redirectors. redirectors as in command and control redirectors.
My goal is to document and automate the deployment of various methods to redirect incoming traffic from a client (a compromized host) to another server (a C&amp;amp;C such as Cobalt Strike or Covenant). The main purpose of this kind of tool is to hide the main server address and thus gain flexibility.</description>
